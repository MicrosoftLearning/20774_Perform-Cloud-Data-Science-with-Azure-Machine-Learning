## Demo 1: Using two-class classification in a machine learning model

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how to:
- Sign into a Machine Learning Studio account.
- Clone a sample experiment.
- View the modules in an experiment.

### Preparation

Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20774A-LON-DC**, and **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and that you are logged on to **20774A-LON-DEV** as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**.

### Sign into your Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio account

1.  On the Start menu, start to type **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Internet Explorer**.
2.  In Internet Explorer®, in the address bar, type **https://studio.azureml.net**, and then press Enter.
3.  On the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** page, click **Sign In**.
4.  Sign in using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure Learning Pass subscription. 

### Clone a sample experiment

1.  In the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** workspace, in the left-hand pane, click **EXPERIMENTS**.
2.  On the **experiments** page, click **SAMPLES**.
3.  In the list of samples, click **Recommender: Movie recommendation**.
4.  At the bottom of the workspace, click **SAVE AS**.
5.  In the **SAVE AS** dialog box, type **My Movie Recommender**, and then click **Ok** (the tick).

### View the modules in the experiment

1.  Zoom in, so that the names of the modules are visible.
2.  Point out that **Movie Ratings** and **IMDB Movie Titles** are the datasets.
