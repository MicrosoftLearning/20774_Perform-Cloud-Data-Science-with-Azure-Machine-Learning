## Demo 1: Using two-class classification in a machine learning model

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how:
- Two-class classification algorithms can be used in the development of a machine learning model.

### Preparation

1.  Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20774A-LON-DC**, and **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and then log on to **20774A-LON-DEV** as **ADATUM\\AdatumAdmin** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
2.  On the Start menu, type **Internet Explorer**, and then click **Internet Explorer**.
3.  In Internet Explorer, in the address bar, type **https://studio.azureml.net**, and then press Enter.
4.  On the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** page, click **Sign In**.
5.  Sign in using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure Learning Pass subscription.

### Open an experiment in Machine Learning Studio
1.  In the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** workspace, in the left-hand pane, click **EXPERIMENTS**.
2.  On the **experiments** page, click **SAMPLES**.
3.  In the list of samples, click **Binary Classification: Flight delay prediction**.
4.  This experiment uses historical on-time performance and weather data to predict whether the arrival of a scheduled passenger flight will be delayed by more than 15 minutes. There are two possible classes: the flight will be delayed, or it will be on time. The classes are labeled 1 if the flight was delayed, and 0 if the flight was on time.
5.  Point out that this experiment starts at the top with two datasets: **Flight Delays Data** and a **Weather Dataset**.
6.  The experiment then includes a range of modules; you will go into more detail about these modules later in this course.
7.  For now, the key things to note are that the data is prepared, and then two different algorithms are applied: **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree**, and **Two-Class Logistic Regression**.

### View the results
1.  Point out that, when an experiment has finished running, all modules will show a green check mark to indicate that they have successfully finished.
2.  Because two different algorithms have been applied, there are two sets of results to look at.
3.  To view the output from the **Score Model** module for the **Two-Class Boosted Decision Tree**, right-click the (lower) output port of the left-hand **Score Model** module, and then click **Visualize** (or double-click this output port).
4.  Scroll right to locate the **Scored Labels** and **Scored Probabilities** columns.
5.  These two columns, **Scored Labels** and **Scored Probabilities**, are the prediction results. The **Scored Probabilities** column shows the probability that a flight was delayed and, therefore, belongs to the positive class (Class 1). For example, the first number in the column (0.42537) means there is 0.42537 probability that the first flight belongs to Class 1. The **Scored Labels** column shows the predicted class for each flight. This is based on the **Scored Probabilities** column. If the scored probability of a flight is larger than 0.5, it is predicted as Class 1. Otherwise, it is predicted as Class 0.
6.  Click the **x** at the top-right of the page, to close the results page.
7.  You will now compare these results with those for Two-Class Logistic Regression.
8.  To view the output from the **Score Model** module for the **Two-Class Logistic Regression**, right-click the (lower) output port of the right-hand **Score Model** module, and then click **Visualize** (or double-click this output port).
9.  Scroll right to locate the **Scored Labels** and **Scored Probabilities** columns.
10. In the **Scored Probabilities** column, the first number in the column is 0.398238, which means there is 0.398238 probability that the first flight belongs to Class 1 (and was delayed).
11. Click the **x** at the top-right of the page, to close the results page.
12. Leave Internet Explorer running, ready for the next demo.

>**Note**: Do not cover details of Machine Learning Studio at this stage—do not show the sign-in, and so on; Machine Learning Studio is covered in Module 2 of this course.

## Demo 2: Using R and Python

### Scenario

In this demonstration, you will see how:
- R scripts can be used within the development of a machine learning model.
- Python scripts can be used within the development of a machine learning model.
- SQL queries can be used within the development of a machine learning model.

### Preparation

This demonstration continues from the previous one. 
Ensure that the **MT17B-WS2016-NAT**, **20774A-LON-DC**, and **20774A-LON-DEV** virtual machines are running, and that you are logged on to **20774A-LON-DEV** as **ADATUM\AdatumAdmin**. Also ensure that Internet Explorer is running, and that you are logged into the **Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio** page, using the Microsoft account that is associated with your Azure Learning Pass subscription.
