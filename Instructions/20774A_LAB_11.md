## Exercise 1: Build a language application

### Scenario
In the first scenario, you will use the Cognitive Services LUIS in a hotel booking bot. You will make a LUIS application that the bot will use to look up the prices and reviews of hotels in any geography.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
1. Build a LUIS application to search for hotels in any geography
2. Install and configure Internet Information Services
3. Using LUIS with bot framework

#### Task 1: Build a LUIS application to search for hotels in any geography
01. Sign in to LUIS at **http://luis.ai**.
02. Create a LUIS app using the bootstrap key.
03. Add three intents to the newly created app:
    - Help
    - SearchHotels
    - ShowHotelsReviews
04. Add two custom simple entities:
    - Hotel
    - AirportCode
05. Add the following utterances to the **Help** intent:
    - What can I do?
    - Help me!
    - What are the available options?
    - I need help
06. Add the following utterances to the **SearchHotels** intent:
    - Look for hotels in Miami
    - Search for hotels in Seattle
    - Show me hotels in California 
    - Find hotels near *eze*
    - Where can I stay near *nnn*?
    - Show hotels near *att* airport
    - Find hotels near *agl*
07. Mark the *italicized* portions of the sentence above as the **AirportCode** entity. This is done by selecting the word on the utterances page.
08. Add the following utterances to the **ShowHotelsReviews** intent:
    - Show me the reviews of the *bot* resort
    - Can I see the extended reviews of *bot* hotel?
    - Find reviews of hotel *xya*
    - Show me reviews of the *amazing* hotel
09. Mark the *italicized* portions as the entity **Hotel**.
10. Add a phrase list, named **near**, with the following values:
    - near
    - around
    - close
    - nearby
11. Add another phrase list, named **show**, with the following values:
    - show
    - find,
    - look
    - search
12. Train, test, and publish your LUIS app.

#### Task 2: Install and configure Internet Information Services
-   Using the Windows Control Panel, install Internet Information Services. Include the following application development features:
    - .NET Extensibility 4.6
    - ASP.NET 4.6

#### Task 3: Using LUIS with bot framework
01. Using Internet Explorer, download the **Bot Framework Emulator**, available at **https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bot-framework/debug-bots-emulator**.
02. Open the Visual Studio Solution- LuisBot from the labs folder. Run Visual Studio as administrator.
03. In the to **Dialogs\RootLuisDialog.cs** file, replace the values in the **LuisModel** attribute of thr **LuisDialog** class with your own AppID and subscription. Your AppID can be found on the **Settings** page for your LUIS app. The subscription key is found under **Key String** on the **Publish** page.
04. Using the project properties editor, change the web server settings to run the application on the local IIS instance with the URL **http://localhost/LuisBot**. Create the virtual directory for the application.
05. Press F5 or the debug play button to start the solution.
06. Wait for the browser window to open, and then in the **Bot Framework Emulator** connect to the URL **http://localhost/LuisBot/api/messages**.
07. Type **hello** to begin communicating with LUIS.
08. Try typing queries like **Where can I stay near ATL** or **Show hotels**.
09. In Internet Explorer, navigate to **http://luis.ai** and select your model. In the left-hand side menu, click **Review endpoint utterances**. Here you will see each of the sentences you submitted, together with the response generated by LUIS and the confidence in the accurancy of that response.
10. Close the Bot Framework Emulator.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a LUIS application to search for hotels in any geography.

## Exercise 2: Build a face detection application

### Scenario
In this exercise, you will build a simple windows application that invokes the Face API to detect and frame faces in an image.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
1. Use the Face API in a Visual Studio application
2. Add face detection to an application

#### Task 1: Use the Face API in a Visual Studio application
1.  Use the Azure Portal to create a Cognitive Services account with the following parameters:
    -   Name: **&lt;yourname-CS1&gt;**
    -   Subscription: **&lt;your classroom subscription&gt;**
    -   Location : **&lt;your nearest location&gt;**
    -   Pricing Tier : **S0**
    -   New Resource Group: **&lt;yourname-CS1RG&gt;**
2.  When the service has been created, retrieve the Face API key.
3.  Create a new C\# WPF application in Visual Studio. Name the project FaceAnalyzer and the solution FaceAnalyzer.sln.
4.  Open the **MainWindow.xaml** file and replace the existing code with code **Snippet 1** from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex2\\CodeSnippets.txt** to create the window UI.
5.  Open **MainWindow.xaml.cs**, and insert code **Snippet 2** inside the **MainWindow** class. This is the code for the '**Browse**' button.
6.  Press F5 to start the solution and upload the photo **MSC13\_Everald\_03.jpg** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex2\\** folder to see it displayed. Next, you will add the functionality to detect faces.

#### Task 2: Add face detection to an application
1.  Open the **NuGet Package Manager** window for the solution, select **nuget.org** as your **Package** source, search for **Microsoft.ProjectOxford.Face** and install the package.
2.  Open **MainWindow.xaml.cs**, and add the code in **Snippet 3** to the beginning of the file.
3.  Insert code **Snippet 4** to the **MainWindow** class directly above the **MainWindow** constructor. Update the **key** value to your **Face API Key**.
4.  Insert code **Snippet 5** into the **MainWindow** class to detect faces. This code utilizes the Face-Detect API, which is the most straightforward way to detect a face.
5.  Add the **async** modifier to the **BrowseButton\_Click** function:
```
	private async void BrowseButton_Click(object sender, RoutedEventArgs e)
	{
	    var openDlg = new Microsoft.Win32.OpenFileDialog();
```
6.  Add code **Snippet 7** to the end of the **BrowseButton\_Click** method. This code draws a frame around detected faces.
7.  Press F5 to run the solution.
8.  Test the application using the files **MSC13\_Everald\_03.jpg**, **MSC13\_Louis\_04.jpg**, and **OFC16\_Meeting\_002.jpg** in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex2** folder.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a face detection application, using the Face API.

## Exercise 3: Build a recommendation application

### Scenario
In the third exercise, you will create a recommendations model for an e-commerce store. You will interract with the model by using curl requests from a bash command prompt.

The main tasks for this exercise are as follows:
1. Install Bash
2. Configure the recommendations model
3. Call the Recommendation API using the curl command

#### Task 1: Install Bash
1.  Configure the **Windows Update** service to start manually. 
2.  Enable **Developer mode**. 
3.  Install the **Windows Subsystem for Linux (Beta)**.
4.  Install **Ubuntu** from https://aka.ms/wslstore and restart the virtual machine.
5.  Add a new UNIX user named **root** with the password **Pa55w.rd**.
6.  Exit the Linux command prompt.

#### Task 2: Configure the recommendations model
1.  In the **Portal.Azure.com** add a **Recommendations AP**I account with the following parameters:
    - Account name: **&lt;yourname-CS2&gt;**
    - Subscription: **&lt;your classroom subscription&gt;**
    - Location : **&lt;your nearest location&gt;**
    - Pricing Tier : **S1**
    - New Resource Group: **&lt;yourname-CS2RG&gt;**
2.  When the service has been created, retrieved the API key.
3.  Navigate to https://recommendations-portal.azurewebsites.net, enter your account key, and log in.
>**Note:** Your login might fail initially, as it can take up to 10 minutes for your account to be registered. If the login fails, wait a few minutes and try again.

4.  On the **Projects** page, add a project called **MyModel1**.
5.  Open the catalog file from **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex3**. Note the structure of the file and the items listed. This is the product list for the Microsoft online store.
6.  Upload the catalog file **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex3\\catalog.csv**.
7.  Upload usage files **usageA.csv**, **usageB.csv**, **usageC.csv**, and **usageD.csv** located in the **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex3** folder.
8.  Build the model, and make a note of the Model ID when the build is complete. The Model ID is a GUID displayed in the page heading.

#### Task 3: Call the Recommendation API using the curl command
-   Use the bash shell to call the recommendation API using the following curl command (replacing **&lt;your API key&gt;** with the API key, and **&lt;Model ID&gt;** with the Model ID GUID):
    ```
	curl -v -X GET "https://westus.api.cognitive.microsoft.com/recommendations/v4.0/models/<ModelID>/recommend/item?itemIds=5C5-00025&numberOfResults=3&minimalScore=.01" -H "Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your API key>"
    ```
The above command can be copied from: **E:\\Labfiles\\Lab11\\Starter\\Ex3\\CurlCmd.txt**.
Verify that this curl command lists item-item recommendations.

**Results**: At the end of this exercise, you will have created a recommendation model and interacted with it using curl requests.

**Question:** In exercise 1, does the Cognitive Services LUIS search Bing for hotel reviews?
